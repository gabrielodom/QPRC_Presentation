The kernel functions used in kernel PCA (KPCA) are profitable for capturing nonlinear property of processes and the time-lagged data extension is suitable for describing dynamic characteristic of processes. DKPCA enables us to monitor an arbitrary process with severe nonlinearity and (or) dynamics. In this respect, it is a generalized concept of multivariate statistical monitoring approaches. A unified monitoring index combined T 2 with SPE is also suggested. The proposed monitoring method based on DKPCA is applied to a simulated nonlinear process and a wastewater treatment process. A comparison study of PCA, dynamic PCA, KPCA, and DKPCA is investigated in terms of type I error rate, type II error rate, and detection delay. The monitoring results confirm that the proposed methodology results in the best monitoring performance, i.e., low missing alarms and small detection delay, for all the faults.},

KPCA and KPLS are applied to these multiscale data to capture process variable correlations occurring at different scales. Main contribution of the paper is to propose nonlinear fault diagnosis methods based on multiscale contribution plots. In particular, the nonlinear scores of the variables at each scale are derived. These nonlinear scale contributions can be computed, which is very useful in diagnosing faults that occur mainly at a single scale. The proposed methods are applied to process monitoring of a continuous annealing process and fused magnesium furnace. Application results indicate that the proposed approach effectively captures the complex relations in the process and improves the diagnosis ability.},

Results prove that although both approaches have their advantages, they also have specific disadvantages as well.

This paper addresses this deficiency by introducing a nonlinearity measure for principal component models. The measure is based on the following two principles: (i) the range of recorded process operation is divided into smaller regions; and (ii) accuracy bounds are determined for the sum of the discarded eigenvalues. If this sum is within the accuracy bounds for each region, the process is assumed to be linear and vice versa. This procedure is automated through the use of cross-validation. Finally, the paper shows the utility of the new nonlinearity measure using two simulation studies and with data from an industrial melter process.},

In this study, we explored the flexibility and robustness of this hybrid membrane system at a demonstration-scale under real-world conditions by tightly managing and controlling operation conditions to produce effluent of different qualities for multipurpose reuse. Results suggest that an SBR-MBR treatment configuration is flexible, robust and resilient to changing operating conditions. The hybrid system was capable of producing different effluent qualities within 1 week of changing operating condition with no adverse effects on membrane performance. This work reinforces the need for a new paradigm of water reclamation and reuse and introduces a new treatment concept facilitating tailored nutrient management for a sustainable urban water infrastructure.},

	abstract = {A reliable model for any wastewater treatment plant is essential in order to provide a tool for predicting its performance and to form a basis for controlling the operation of the process. This would minimize the operation costs and assess the stability of environmental balance. This process is complex and attains a high degree of nonlinearity due to the presence of bio-organic constituents that are difficult to model using mechanistic approaches. Predicting the plant operational parameters using conventional experimental techniques is also a time consuming step and is an obstacle in the way of efficient control of such processes. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) black-box modeling approach was used to acquire the knowledge base of a real wastewater plant and then used as a process model. The study signifies that the ANNs are capable of capturing the plant operation characteristics with a good degree of accuracy. A computer model is developed that incorporates the trained ANN plant model. The developed program is implemented and validated using plant-scale data obtained from a local wastewater treatment plant, namely the Doha West wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). It is used as a valuable performance assessment tool for plant operators and decision makers. The ANN model provided accurate predictions of the effluent stream, in terms of biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS) when using COD as an input in the crude supply stream. It can be said that the ANN predictions based on three crude supply inputs together, namely BOD, COD and TSS, resulted in better ANN predictions when using only one crude supply input. Graphical user interface representation of the ANN for the Doha West WWTP data is performed and presented.},

In this paper, a robust version of NLPCA is introduced by replacing the generally used error criterion mean squared error with a mean log squared error. This is followed by a concise analysis of the corresponding training method. A novel multivariate statistical process monitoring (MSPM) scheme incorporating the proposed robust NLPCA technique is then investigated and its efficiency is assessed through application to an industrial fluidized catalytic cracking plant. The results demonstrate that, compared with NLPCA, the proposed approach can effectively reduce the number of false alarms and is, hence, expected to better monitor real-world processes.},

PCA has been used by several authors to develop techniques to monitor chemical processes and detect the presence of disturbances [1–5]. In past work, we have developed methods which not only detect disturbances, but isolate the sources of the disturbances [4]. The approach was based on static PCA models, T2 and Q charts [6], and a model bank of possible disturbances. In this paper we use a well-known ‘time lag shift’ method to include dynamic behavior in the PCA model. The proposed dynamic PCA model development procedure is desirable due to its simplicity of construction, and is not meant to replace the many well-known and more elegant procedures used in model identification. While dynamic linear model identification, and time lag shift are well known methods in model building, this is the first application we are aware of in the area of statistical process monitoring. Extensive testing on the Tennessee Eastman process simulation [7] demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

	abstract = {A new fault detection and identification method based on kernel principal component analysis (PCA) is described. In the past, numerous PCA-based statistical process monitoring methods have been developed and applied to various chemical processes. However, these previous methods assume that the monitored process is linear, whereas most of the chemical reactions in chemical processes are nonlinear. For such nonlinear systems, PCA-based monitoring has proved inefficient and problematic, prompting the development of several nonlinear PCA methods. In this paper, we propose a new nonlinear PCA-based method that uses kernel functions, and we compare the proposed method with previous methods. A unified fault detection index is developed based on the energy approximation concept. In particular, a new approach to fault identification, which is a challenging problem in nonlinear PCA, is formulated based on a robust reconstruction error calculation. The proposed monitoring method was applied to two simple nonlinear processes and the simulated continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) process. The monitoring results confirm that the proposed methodology affords credible fault detection and identification.},

	abstract = {Background:
Large gene expression studies, such as those conducted using DNA arrays, often provide millions of different pieces of data. To address the problem of analyzing such data, we describe a statistical method, which we have called 'gene shaving'. The method identifies subsets of genes with coherent expression patterns and large variation across conditions. Gene shaving differs from hierarchical clustering and other widely used methods for analyzing gene expression studies in that genes may belong to more than one cluster, and the clustering may be supervised by an outcome measure. The technique can be 'unsupervised', that is, the genes and samples are treated as unlabeled, or partially or fully supervised by using known properties of the genes or samples to assist in finding meaningful groupings.

Results:
We illustrate the use of the gene shaving method to analyze gene expression measurements made on samples from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The method identifies a small cluster of genes whose expression is highly predictive of survival.

Conclusions:
The gene shaving method is a potentially useful tool for exploration of gene expression data and identification of interesting clusters of genes worth further investigation.},

	abstract = {Fault detection is an essential part of the operation of any chemical plant. Early detection of faults is important in chemical industry since a lot of damage and loss can result before a fault present in the system is detected. Even though fault detection algorithms are designed and implemented for quickly detecting incidents, most these algorithms do not have an optimal property in terms of detection delay with respect to false alarm rate. Based on the optimization property of cumulative sum (CUSUM), a real-time system for detecting changes in dynamic systems is designed in this paper. This work is motivated by combining two fault detection (FD) strategies; a simplified procedure of the incident detection problem is formulated by using both the artificial neural networks (ANN) and the CUSUM statistical test (Page–Hinkley test). The design of a model-based residual generator is intended to reveal any drift from the normal behavior of the process. In order to obtain a reliable model for the normal process dynamics, the neural black-box modeling by means of a nonlinear auto-regressive with eXogenous input (NARX) model has been chosen in this study. This paper also shows the choice and the performance of the neural network in the training and test phases. After describing the system architecture and the proposed methodology of the fault detection, we present a realistic application in order to show the technique’s potential. The purpose is to develop and test the fault detection method on a real incident data, to detect the change presence, and pinpoint the moment it occurred. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the FD method.},

Specify before the analysis what kinds of patterns you would expect and what you would find exciting. The results of the analysis depend on the scaling of the matrix, which therefore must be specified. Variance scaling, where each variable is scaled to unit variance, can be recommended for general use, provided that almost constant variables are left unscaled. Combining different types of variables warrants blockscaling. In the initial analysis, look for outliers and strong groupings in the plots, indicating that the data matrix perhaps should be “polished” or whether disjoint modeling is the proper course. For plotting purposes, two or three principal components are usually sufficient, but for modeling purposes the number of significant components should be properly determined, e.g. by cross-validation. Use the resulting principal components to guide your continued investigation or chemical experimentation, not as an end in itself.},

Secondly, the probability of a false warning in a control chart is computed. In order to evaluate the five approaches, five different data sets are studied: one simulation of a batch process, three batch processes obtained from industry and one laboratory spectral data set.

The latter, which is based on the Fisher criterion, is incapable of dealing with heteroscedastic data in a proper way. For the two-class case, the between-class scatter is generalized so to capture differences in (co)variances. It is shown that the classical notion of between-class scatter can be associated with Euclidean distances between class means. From this viewpoint, the between-class scatter is generalized by employing the Chernoff distance measure, leading to our proposed heteroscedastic measure. Finally, using the results from the two-class case, a multiclass extension of the Chernoff criterion is proposed. This criterion combines separation information present in the class mean as well as the class covariance matrices.

ICA is a recently developed method in which the goal is to decompose observed data into linear combinations of statistically independent components [1,2]. Such a representation has been shown to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including signal separation and feature extraction. The basic idea of our approach is to use ICA to extract the essential independent components that drive a process and to combine them with process monitoring techniques. I2, Ie2 and SPE charts are proposed as on-line monitoring charts and contribution plots of these statistical quantities are also considered for fault identification. The proposed monitoring method was applied to fault detection and identification in both a simple multivariate process and the simulation benchmark of the biological wastewater treatment process, which is characterized by a variety of fault sources with non-Gaussian characteristics. The simulation results clearly show the power and advantages of ICA monitoring in comparison to PCA monitoring.},

	abstract = {Contaminated water resources have important implications on health and the environment. Nitrate contamination of the groundwater is a serious problem in the European Union. A method based on the statistical process control (SPC) and time series analysis is developed to monitoring and to predict the concentration evolution of nitrate (NO3−) in groundwater. In many pumping wells the NO3−concentration ([NO3−]) increases and approaches or even passes the European Community standard of 50 mg l−1. The objective of this paper is to show the application of statistical process control as a monitoring tool for groundwater pollution from agricultural practices. We propose the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model as a management tool to monitoring and reduction of the intrusion of nitrate into the groundwater. This tool should help in setting up useful guidelines for evaluating actual environmental performance against the firm’s environmental objectives and targets and regulatory requirements. We concluded that the statistical process control method may be a potentially important way of monitoring groundwater quality that also permits rapid response to serious increases in pollutants concentrations. In doing so, the paper fills an important gap in the water pollution standards and emerging polices (Water Framework directives).},

Whereas spectral embedding methods provided only coordinates for the training points, the analysis justifies a simple extension to out-of-sample examples (the Nyström formula) for multidimensional scaling (MDS), spectral clustering, Laplacian eigenmaps, locally linear embedding (LLE), and Isomap. The analysis provides, for all such spectral embedding methods, the definition of a loss function, whose empirical average is minimized by the traditional algorithms. The asymptotic expected value of that loss defines a generalization performance and clarifies what these algorithms are trying to learn. Experiments with LLE, Isomap, spectral clustering, and MDS show that this out-of-sample embedding formula generalizes well, with a level of error comparable to the effect of small perturbations of the training set on the embedding.},

In addition it is usually desired that these regions be describable in an interpretable form involving simple statements (“rules”) concerning the input values. This paper presents a procedure directed towards this goal based on the notion of “patient” rule induction. This patient strategy is contrasted with the greedy ones used by most rule induction methods, and semi-greedy ones used by some partitioning tree techniques such as CART.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is known as a popular method for diagnosis but as it is basically a linear method, it may pass over some useful nonlinear features of the system behavior. One possible extension of PCA is Kernel PCA (KPCA), owing to the use of nonlinear kernel functions that allow introduction of nonlinear dependences between variables. The objective of this paper is to address the problem of fault detection (in terms of nonlinear activation) in mechanical systems using a KPCA-based method. The detection is achieved by comparing the subspaces between the reference and a current state of the system through the concept of subspace angle. It is shown in this work that the exploitation of the measurements in the form of block Hankel matrices can effectively improve the detection results. The method is illustrated on an experimental example consisting of a beam with a geometric nonlinearity.},

Dynamic principal component analysis (DPCA) and canonical variate analysis (CVA) are data dimensionality techniques which take into account serial correlations, but their effectiveness in detecting faults in industrial processes has not been extensively tested. In this paper, score/state and residual space PCA, DPCA, and CVA are applied to the Tennessee Eastman process simulator, which was designed to simulate a wide variety of faults occurring in a chemical plant based on a facility at Eastman Chemical. This appears to be the first application of residual space CVA statistics for detecting faults in a large-scale process.

Statistics quantifying variations in the residual space were usually more sensitive but less robust to the faults than the statistics quantifying the variations in the score or state space. The statistics exhibiting a small missed detection rate tended to exhibit small detection delays and vice versa. A residual-based CVA statistic proposed in this paper gave the best overall sensitivity and promptness, but the initially proposed threshold for the statistic lacked robustness. This motivated increasing the threshold to achieve a specified missed detection rate.},

Let 2 ⩽ m ⩽ n , A be an m × n nonnegative matrix with maximum entry α, and ‖ A ‖ 1 ⩾ n α . Extending previous results of Koolen and Moulton for graphs, we prove that E ( A ) ⩽ ‖ A ‖ 1 m n + ( m − 1 ) ( ‖ A ‖ 2 2 − ‖ A ‖ 1 2 m n ) ⩽ α n ( m + m ) 2 . Furthermore, if A is any nonconstant matrix, then E ( A ) ⩾ σ 1 ( A ) + ‖ A ‖ 2 2 − σ 1 2 ( A ) σ 2 ( A ) .

In this paper we consider the problem of determining the minimum dimension necessary for quadratic discrimination in normal populations with heterogeneous covariance matrices.

Simulations are used to investigate the adequacy of the chi-squared approximations and to compare the misclassification probabilities of reduced-dimension quadratic discrimination with full-dimension quadratic discrimination.},

Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

Two additional byproduct reactions also occur. The process has 12 valves available for manipulation and 41 measurements available for monitoring or control. The process equipment, operating objectives, process control objectives and process disturbances are described. A set of FORTRAN subroutines which simulate the process are available upon request. The chemical process model presented here is a challenging problem for a wide variety of process control technology studies.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Discrimination between two classes such as normal and cancer samples and between two types of cancers based on gene expression profiles is an important problem which has practical implications as well as the potential to further our understanding of gene expression of various cancer cells. Classification or discrimination of more than two groups or classes (multi-class) is also needed. The need for multi-class discrimination methodologies is apparent in many microarray experiments where various cancer types are considered simultaneously.
RESULTS: Thus, in this paper we present the extension to the classification methodology proposed earlier Nguyen and Rocke (2002b; Bioinformatics, 18, 39-50) to classify cancer samples from multiple classes. The methodologies proposed in this paper are applied to four gene expression data sets with multiple classes: (a) a hereditary breast cancer data set with (1) BRCA1-mutation, (2) BRCA2-mutation and (3) sporadic breast cancer samples, (b) an acute leukemia data set with (1) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), (2) T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and (3) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) samples, (c) a lymphoma data set with (1) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), (2) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL) and (3) follicular lymphoma (FL) samples, and (d) the NCI60 data set with cell lines derived from cancers of various sites of origin. In addition, we evaluated the classification algorithms and examined the variability of the error rates using simulations based on randomization of the real data sets. We note that there are other methods for addressing multi-class prediction recently and our approach is along the line of Nguyen and Rocke (2002b; Bioinformatics, 18, 39-50).

Secondly, the inner class distance of data was calculated as an index of fault detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved LLE method, it is applied to Tennessee Eastman (TE) process and compared with kernel principle component analysis (KPCA) method. By simulation analysis, the false negative rate of the proposed approach achieves 4.498\% in average, which is much better than 77.53\% of KPCA, certifying the effectiveness of the approach to nonlinear fault detection.},

While previous adaptive KPCA models allow only handling of one observation at a time, in this study we propose a way to fast update or downdate the KPCA model when a block of data is provided and not only one observation. Using a variable window size procedure to determine the model size and adaptive chart parameters, this model is applied to monitor two simulated benchmark processes.

The contribution of this article is the development of a numerically efficient and memory saving moving window KPCA (MWKPCA) monitoring approach. The proposed technique incorporates an up- and downdating procedure to adapt (i) the data mean and covariance matrix in the feature space and (ii) approximates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Gram matrix. The article shows that the proposed MWKPCA algorithm has a computation complexity of O(N2), whilst batch techniques, e.g. the Lanczos method, are of O(N3). Including the adaptation of the number of retained components and an l-step ahead application of the MWKPCA monitoring model, the paper finally demonstrates the utility of the proposed technique using a simulated nonlinear time-varying system and recorded data from an industrial distillation column.},

The simultaneous modeling of the dependencies along the “variable” and “time” modes, allows for a more compact and rigorous description of the normal behavior of processes, laying the ground for the development of, for instance, improved Statistical Process Monitoring (SPM) methodologies, able to robustly detect finer deviations from normal operation conditions. A key point in the application of DPCA is the definition of its structure, namely the selection of the number of time-shifted replicates for each variable to include, and the number of components to retain in the final model. In order to address the first of these two fundamental design aspects of DPCA, and arguably the most complex one, we propose two new lag selection methods.The first method estimates a single lag structure for all variables, whereas the second one refines this procedure, providing the specific number of lags to be used for each individual variable. The application of these two proposed methodologies to several case studies led to a more rigorous estimation of the number of lags really involved in the dynamical mechanisms of the processes under analysis. This feature can be explored for implementing improved system identification, process monitoring and process control tasks that rely upon a DPCA modeling framework.},

A fault diagnosis method using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is proposed to affectively capture the nonlinear relationship of the process variables, which computes principal component in high dimensional feature space by means of integral operators and nonlinear kernel functions. The faults are detected by calculating the statistics of the square prediction error (SPE) and identified by calculating the change diagram of contribution percentage of Hostelling T2T2 \{T{\textasciicircum}2\} . At last, employing the actual data from wet flue gas desulphurization system of Huaneng Fuzhou power plant, it’s proved effectively to detect and identify four kinds of faults, which is the complete invalidation fault, fixed bias fault, drift bias fault and precision degradation fault. The result shows the KPCA method has a good performance in fault detection and diagnosis.},

Introduction  Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a mathematical tool widely used for dimensionality reduction and multi-class classification [1], [2], [3]. Our interest in LDA [4] stems from our desire to use auditory features in speech recognition and from the encouraging results obtained by Brown [5]. However, inconsistent modeling assumptions between LDA, and the models used for recognition yield final systems with non-optimum performance.

Here we give an analogous result for incremental forward stagewise regression, showing that it solves a version of the lasso problem that enforces monotonicity. One consequence of this is as follows: while lasso makes optimal progress in terms of reducing the residual sum-of-squares per unit increase in L1-norm of the coefficient β, forward stage-wise is optimal per unit L1 arc-length traveled along the coefficient path. We also study a condition under which the coefficient paths of the lasso are monotone, and hence the different algorithms coincide. Finally, we compare the lasso and forward stagewise procedures in a simulation study involving a large number of correlated predictors.},

	abstract = {Water reclamation and reuse provides a unique and viable opportunity to augment traditional water supplies. As a multi-disciplined and an important element of water resources development and management, water reuse can help to close the loop between water supply and wastewater disposal. Effective water reuse requires integration of water and reclaimed water supply functions. The successful development of this reliable water resource depends upon close examination and synthesis of elements from infrastructure and facilities planning, wastewater treatment plant siting, treatment process reliability, economic and financial analyses, public acceptance, and water utility management.

A key factor limiting the implementation of water reuse systems is often the cost of infrastructure needed for a conventional water reuse system, where the water reuse system consists generally of an upgraded secondary treatment process sited at an existing wastewater-treatment facility. It is often prohibitive logistically to return reclaimed water to urban areas where it could be used at maximum benefit to offset potable water supply consumption. The issues related to the return of reclaimed water to urban areas can be overcome, in part, using distributed water reuse systems such as satellite and decentralized configurations. In addition to a discussion on the alternative infrastructure approaches for water reuse, applications for reclaimed water, treatment technologies, and source control for upstream management of specific constituents are described briefly.},

Many previous studies focus on the detectability of monitoring a multivariate process by using TE process as an example. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used dimension-reduction tool for monitoring multivariate linear process. Recently, the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) has emerged as an effective method to tackling the problem of nonlinear data. Nevertheless, the conventional KPCA used the sum of squares of latest observations as the monitoring statistics and hence failed to detect small disturbance of the process. To enhance the detectability of the KPCA-based monitoring method, an adaptive KPCA-based monitoring statistic is proposed in this paper. The basic idea of the proposed method is first adopting the multivariate exponentially moving average to predict the process mean shifts and then combining the estimated mean shifts with the extracted components by KPCA to construct the adaptive monitoring statistic. The efficiency of the proposed monitoring scheme is implemented in a simulated nonlinear system and in the TE process. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional PCA and KPCA monitoring schemes.},

Techniques for monitoring these batch processes to ensure their safe operation and to produce consistently high-quality products are needed. Nomikos and MacGregor (1994) presented a multiway principal component analysis (MPCA) approach for monitoring batch processes, and test results show that the method is simple, powerful, and effective. MPCA, however, is a linear method, and most batch processes are nonlinear. Although data treatment techniques can remove some nonlinearity from the data, nonlinearity is still a problem when using MPCA for monitoring. In this article a nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) method (Dong and McAvoy, 1993) is used for batch process monitoring. Results show that this method is excellent for this problem. Another interesting extension of this approach involves multistage batch process monitoring, which is illustrated through a detailed simulation study.},

This leads to a multivariate regression model that we call the envelope model, where the number of parameters is maximally reduced.

	abstract = {Modern advances in computing power have greatly widened scientists' scope in gathering and investigating information from many variables, information which might have been ignored in the past. Yet to effectively scan a large pool of variables is not an easy task, although our ability to interact with data has been much enhanced by recent innovations in dynamic graphics. In this article, we propose a novel data-analytic tool, sliced inverse regression (SIR), for reducing the dimension of the input variable x without going through any parametric or nonparametric model-fitting process. This method explores the simplicity of the inverse view of regression; that is, instead of regressing the univariate output variable y against the multivariate x, we regress x against y. Forward regression and inverse regression are connected by a theorem that motivates this method. The theoretical properties of SIR are investigated under a model of the form, y = f(β1x, ..., βKx, ε), where the βk's are the unknown row vectors. This model looks like a nonlinear regression, except for the crucial difference that the functional form of f is completely unknown. For effectively reducing the dimension, we need only to estimate the space [effective dimension reduction (e.d.r.) space] generated by the βk's. This makes our goal different from the usual one in regression analysis, the estimation of all the regression coefficients. In fact, the βk's themselves are not identifiable without a specific structural form on f. Our main theorem shows that under a suitable condition, if the distribution of x has been standardized to have the zero mean and the identity covariance, the inverse regression curve, E(x ∣ y), will fall into the e.d.r. space. Hence a principal component analysis on the covariance matrix for the estimated inverse regression curve can be conducted to locate its main orientation, yielding our estimates for e.d.r. directions. Furthermore, we use a simple step function to estimate the inverse regression curve. No complicated smoothing is needed. SIR can be easily implemented on personal computers. By simulation, we demonstrate how SIR can effectively reduce the dimension of the input variable from, say, 10 to K = 2 for a data set with 400 observations. The spin-plot of y against the two projected variables obtained by SIR is found to mimic the spin-plot of y against the true directions very well. A chi-squared statistic is proposed to address the issue of whether or not a direction found by SIR is spurious.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear principal component analysis is a novel technique for multivariate data analysis, similar to the well-known method of principal component analysis. NLPCA, like PCA, is used to identify and remove correlations among problem variables as an aid to dimensionality reduction, visualization, and exploratory data analysis. While PCA identifies only linear correlations between variables, NLPCA uncovers both linear and nonlinear correlations, without restriction on the character of the nonlinearities present in the data. NLPCA operates by training a feedforward neural network to perform the identity mapping, where the network inputs are reproduced at the output layer. The network contains an internal “bottleneck” layer (containing fewer nodes than input or output layers), which forces the network to develop a compact representation of the input data, and two additional hidden layers. The NLPCA method is demonstrated using time-dependent, simulated batch reaction data. Results show that NLPCA successfully reduces dimensionality and produces a feature space map resembling the actual distribution of the underlying system parameters.},

	abstract = {The Tennessee Eastman (TE) process, created by Eastman Chemical Company, is a complex nonlinear process. Many previous studies focus on the detectability of monitoring a multivariate process by using TE process as an example. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used dimension-reduction tool for monitoring multivariate linear process. Recently, the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) has emerged as an effective method to tackling the problem of nonlinear data. Nevertheless, the conventional KPCA used the sum of squares of latest observations as the monitoring statistics and hence failed to detect small disturbance of the process. To enhance the detectability of the KPCA-based monitoring method, an adaptive KPCA-based monitoring statistic is proposed in this paper. The basic idea of the proposed method is first adopting the multivariate exponentially moving average to predict the process mean shifts and then combining the estimated mean shifts with the extracted components by KPCA to construct the adaptive monitoring statistic. The efficiency of the proposed monitoring scheme is implemented in a simulated nonlinear system and in the TE process. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional PCA and KPCA monitoring schemes.},

Using the gradient of kernel function, we define two new statistics which represent the contribution of each variable to the monitoring statistics, Hotelling's T 2 and squared prediction error (SPE) of kernel PCA, respectively. The proposed statistics which have similar concept to contributions in linear PCA are directly derived from the mathematical formulation of kernel PCA and thus they are straightforward to understand. The main contribution of this work is that we firstly suggest a fault identification method especially applicable to process monitoring using kernel PCA. To demonstrate the performance, the proposed method is applied to two simulated processes, one is a simple nonlinear process and the other is a non-isothermal CSTR process. The simulation results show that the proposed method effectively identifies the source of various types of faults.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel Rayleigh quotient based sparse quadratic dimension reduction method - named QUADRO (Quadratic Dimension Reduction via Rayleigh Optimization) - for analyzing high- dimensional data. Unlike in the linear setting where Rayleigh quotient optimization coincides with classification, these two problems are very different under nonlinear settings. In this paper, we clarify this difference and show that Rayleigh quotient optimization may be of independent scientific interests. One major challenge of Rayleigh quotient optimization is that the variance of quadratic statistics involves all fourth cross-moments of predictors, which are infeasible to compute for high-dimensional applications and may accumulate too many stochastic errors. This issue is resolved by considering a family of elliptical models. Moreover, for heavy-tail distributions, robust estimates of mean vectors and covariance matrices are employed to guarantee uniform convergence in estimating nonpolynomially many parameters, even though only the fourth moments are assumed. Methodologically, QUADRO is based on elliptical models which allow us to formulate the Rayleigh quotient maximization as a convex optimization problem. Computationally, we propose an efficient linearized augmented Lagrangian method to solve the constrained optimization problem. Theoretically, we provide explicit rates of convergence in terms of Rayleigh quotient under both Gaussian and general elliptical models. Thorough numerical results on both synthetic and real datasets are also provided to back up our theoretical results.},

While methods based on principal component analysis (PCA) are popular, more recently kernel PCA (KPCA) and locally linear embedding (LLE) have been utilized to better model nonlinear process data. Additionally, various forms of dynamic and adaptive monitoring schemes have been proposed to address time-varying features in these processes. In this analysis, we extend a common simulation study in order to account for autocorrelation and nonstationarity in process data and comprehensively compare the monitoring performances of static, dynamic, adaptive, and adaptive–dynamic versions of PCA, KPCA, and LLE. Furthermore, we evaluate a nonparametric method to set thresholds for monitoring statistics and compare results with the standard parametric approaches. We then apply these methods to real-world data collected from a decentralized wastewater treatment system during normal and abnormal operations. From the simulation study, adaptive–dynamic versions of all three methods generally improve results when the process is autocorrelated and nonstationary. In the case study, adaptive–dynamic versions of PCA, KPCA, and LLE all flag a strong system fault, but nonparametric thresholds considerably reduce the number of false alarms for all three methods under normal operating conditions.},

KPCA has emerged in recent years as a promising method for tackling nonlinear systems. KPCA can efficiently compute principal components in high-dimensional feature spaces by means of integral operators and nonlinear kernel functions. The basic idea of KPCA is to first map the input space into a feature space via nonlinear mapping and then to compute the principal components in that feature space. In comparison to other nonlinear principal component analysis (PCA) techniques, KPCA requires only the solution of an eigenvalue problem and does not entail any nonlinear optimization. In addition, the number of principal components need not be specified prior to modeling. In this paper, a simple approach to calculating the squared prediction error (SPE) in the feature space is also suggested. Based on T2 and SPE charts in the feature space, KPCA was applied to fault detection in two example systems: a simple multivariate process and the simulation benchmark of the biological wastewater treatment process. The proposed approach effectively captured the nonlinear relationship in the process variables and showed superior process monitoring performance compared to linear PCA.},

However, the performance of the QDF quickly deteriorates as the dimension p increases relative to the sample size n i i = l , 2 . The deterioration is principally due to poor estimates of the inverse of the covariance matrices, . One method of combating this problem is to apply biased estimators of the inverse of the covariance matrices. In this paper we contrast the performance of the QDF with respect to several biased estimators and one unbiased estimator of A shrinkage estimator proposed by Peck and Van Ness (1982) is found to yield superior performance over a wide range of configurations and training sample sizes.},

It is of interest to develop techniques for extracting useful information from the resulting data sets. Here we report the application of a two-way clustering method for analyzing a data set consisting of the expression patterns of different cell types. Gene expression in 40 tumor and 22 normal colon tissue samples was analyzed with an Affymetrix oligonucleotide array complementary to more than 6,500 human genes. An efficient two-way clustering algorithm was applied to both the genes and the tissues, revealing broad coherent patterns that suggest a high degree of organization underlying gene expression in these tissues. Coregulated families of genes clustered together, as demonstrated for the ribosomal proteins. Clustering also separated cancerous from noncancerous tissue and cell lines from in vivo tissues on the basis of subtle distributed patterns of genes even when expression of individual genes varied only slightly between the tissues. Two-way clustering thus may be of use both in classifying genes into functional groups and in classifying tissues based on gene expression.},

	abstract = {Many contemporary studies involve the classification of a subject into two classes based on n observations of the p variables associated with the subject. Under the assumption that the variables are normally distributed, the well-known linear discriminant analysis (LDA) assumes a common covariance matrix over the two classes while the quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) allows different covariance matrices. When p is much smaller than n, even if they both diverge, the LDA and QDA have the smallest asymptotic misclassification rates for the cases of equal and unequal covariance matrices, respectively. However, modern statistical studies often face classification problems with the number of variables much larger than the sample size n, and the classical LDA and QDA can perform poorly. In fact, we give an example in which the QDA performs as poorly as random guessing even if we know the true covariances. Under some sparsity conditions on the unknown means and covariance matrices of the two classes, we propose a sparse QDA based on thresholding that has the smallest asymptotic misclassification rate conditional on the training data. We discuss an example of classifying normal and tumor colon tissues based on a set of p = 2,000 genes and a sample of size n = 62, and another example of a cardiovascular study for n = 222 subjects with p = 2,434 genes. A simulation is also conducted to check the performance of the proposed method.},

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs—30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers—a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

The concept class isweakly learnable if the learner can produce an hypothesis that performs only slightly better than random guessing. In this paper, it is shown that these two notions of learnability are equivalent.A method is described for converting a weak learning algorithm into one that achieves arbitrarily high accuracy. This construction may have practical applications as a tool for efficiently converting a mediocre learning algorithm into one that performs extremely well.

	abstract = {Nearest shrunken centroids (NSC) is a popular classification method for microarray data. NSC calculates centroids for each class and “shrinks” the centroids toward 0 using soft thresholding. Future observations are then assigned to the class with the minimum distance between the observation and the (shrunken) centroid. Under certain conditions the soft shrinkage used by NSC is equivalent to a LASSO penalty. However, this penalty can produce biased estimates when the true coefficients are large. In addition, NSC ignores the fact that multiple measures of the same gene are likely to be related to one another. We consider several alternative genewise shrinkage methods to address the aforementioned shortcomings of NSC. Three alternative penalties were considered: the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), the adaptive LASSO (ADA), and the minimax concave penalty (MCP). We also showed that NSC can be performed in a genewise manner. Classification methods were derived for each alternative shrinkage method or alternative genewise penalty, and the performance of each new classification method was compared with that of conventional NSC on several simulated and real microarray data sets. Moreover, we applied the geometric mean approach for the alternative penalty functions. In general the alternative (genewise) penalties required fewer genes than NSC. The geometric mean of the class-specific prediction accuracies was improved, as well as the overall predictive accuracy in some cases. These results indicate that these alternative penalties should be considered when using NSC.},

	abstract = {Regularized discriminant analysis (RDA), proposed by Friedman (1989), is a widely popular classifier that lacks interpretability and is impractical for high-dimensional data sets. Here, we present an interpretable and computationally efficient classifier called high-dimensional RDA (HDRDA), designed for the small-sample, high-dimensional setting. For HDRDA, we show that each training observation, regardless of class, contributes to the class covariance matrix, resulting in an interpretable estimator that borrows from the pooled sample covariance matrix. Moreover, we show that HDRDA is equivalent to a classifier in a reduced-feature space with dimension approximately equal to the training sample size. As a result, the matrix operations employed by HDRDA are computationally linear in the number of features, making the classifier well-suited for high-dimensional classification in practice. We demonstrate that HDRDA is often superior to several sparse and regularized classifiers in terms of classification accuracy with three artificial and six real high-dimensional data sets. Also, timing comparisons between our HDRDA implementation in the sparsediscrim R package and the standard RDA formulation in the klaR R package demonstrate that as the number of features increases, the computational runtime of HDRDA is drastically smaller than that of RDA.},

Several fault detection indices in the literature are analyzed and unified. Fault reconstruction for both sensor and process faults is presented which extends the traditional missing value replacement method. Fault diagnosis methods that have appeared recently are reviewed. The reconstruction-based approach and the contribution-based approach are analyzed and compared with simulation and industrial examples. The complementary nature of the reconstruction- and contribution-based approaches is highlighted. An industrial example of polyester film process monitoring is given to demonstrate the power of the contribution- and reconstruction-based approaches in a hierarchical monitoring framework. Finally we demonstrate that the reconstruction-based framework provides a convenient way for fault analysis, including fault detectability, reconstructability and identifiability conditions, resolving many theoretical issues in process monitoring. Additional topics are summarized at the end of the paper for future investigation. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This paper discusses how PCA can be used on operating data from the West Valley Liquid Fed Ceramic Melter to help identify process upsets, off-specification operating conditions and failing process sensors. PCA has often been applied to pattern recognition and analytical classification problems. This work, however, represents a new application in that PCA has not previously been applied to data from a dynamic system. The result of this work is a technique for monitoring multivariable processes as projections of the process data into lower dimensional spaces which are most descriptive for the process},

Extensions of traditional univariate Shewhart, CUSUM and EWMA control charts to multivariate quality control situations are based on Hotelling's T2 statistic. Recent approaches to multivariate statistical process control which utilize not only product quality data (Y), but also all of the available process variable data (X) are based on multivariate statistical projection methods (Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS)). This paper gives an overview of these methods, and their use for the statistical process control of both continuous and batch multivariate processes. Examples are provided of their use for analysing the operations of a mineral processing plant, for on-line monitoring and fault diagnosis of a continuous polymerization process and for the on-line monitoring of an industrial batch polymerization reactor.},

Operating personnel typically use only a few variables to monitor the plant's performance. However, multivariate statistical methods such as PLS (Partial Least Squares or Projection to Latent Structures) and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) are capable of compressing the information down into low dimensional spaces which retain most of the information. Using this method of statistical data compression a multivariate monitoring procedure analogous to the univariate Shewart Chart has been developed to efficiently monitor the performance of large processes, and to rapidly detect and identify important process changes. This procedure is demonstrated using simulations of two processes, a fluidized bed reactor and an extractive distillation column.},

Another important extension of MSPC was made by using multiscale PCA (MS-PCA). In the present work, the characteristics of several monitoring methods are investigated. The monitoring performances are compared with using simulated data obtained from the Tennessee Eastman process. The results show that the advanced methods can outperform the conventional method. Furthermore, the advantage of MPCA and DISSIM over conventional MSPC (cMSPC) and that of the multiscale method are combined, and the new methods known as MS-MPCA and MS-DISSIM are proposed.},

	abstract = {In the procedure to monitor a new batch using the method proposed by Nomikos and MacGregor [AIChE J. 1994, 40 (8), 1361−1375], an assumption about the unknown future samples in the batch has to be taken. This work demonstrates that using the missing data option and solving the score estimation problem with an appropriate method are equivalent to the use of an accurate adaptive forecast model for the future samples over the shrinking horizon of the remainder of the batch. The dynamic properties of the principal component analysis (PCA) model are illustrated by re-expressing the projection model as a time-varying multivariate prediction model. The benefits of using the missing data estimation option are analyzed by contrasting it with other options on the basis of (i) the accuracy of the forecast done for the unknown samples, (ii) the quality of the score estimates, and (iii) the detection performance during monitoring. Because of the tremendous structural information built into these multivariate PCA models for batch processes, the missing data option is shown to yield the best performance by all measures in predicting the future unknown part of the trajectory, even from the beginning of the batch. However, for the purpose of online detection of process faults (in process monitoring), the differences among the trajectory estimation methods appear to be much less critical because the control charts used in each case are tailored to the filling-in mechanism employed. All of the approaches appear to provide powerful charting methods for monitoring the progress of batch processes.},

	abstract = {In this work, a new multivariate method to monitor continuous processes is developed based on the statistics pattern analysis (SPA) framework. The SPA framework was proposed recently to address some challenges associated with batch process monitoring, such as unsynchronized batch trajectories and multimodal distribution. The major difference between the principal component analysis (PCA) based and SPA-based fault detection methods is that PCA monitors process variables while SPA monitors the statistics of process variables. In other words, PCA examines the variance−covariance of the process variables to perform fault detection while SPA examines the variance−covariance of the process variable statistics (e.g., mean, variance, autocorrelation, cross-correlation, etc.) to perform fault detection. In this paper, a window-based SPA method is proposed to address the challenges associated with continuous processes such as nonlinear process dynamics. First, the details of the window-based SPA method are presented; then the basic properties of the SPA method for fault detection are discussed and illustrated using a simple nonlinear example. Finally, the potential of the window-based SPA method in monitoring continuous processes is explored using two case studies (a 2 × 2 linear dynamic process and the challenging Tennessee Eastman process). The performance of the window-based SPA method is compared with the benchmark PCA and DPCA methods. The monitoring results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {An important tool in information analysis is dimensionality reduction. There are various approaches for large data simplification by scaling its dimensions down that play a significant role in recognition and classification tasks. The efficiency of dimension reduction tools is measured in terms of memory and computational complexity, which are usually a function of the number of the given data points. Sparse local operators that involve substantially less than quadratic complexity at one end, and faithful multiscale models with quadratic cost at the other end, make the design of dimension reduction procedure a delicate balance between modeling accuracy and efficiency. Here, we combine the benefits of both and propose a low-dimensional multiscale modeling of the data, at a modest computational cost. The idea is to project the classical multidimensional scaling problem into the data spectral domain extracted from its Laplace–Beltrami operator. There, embedding into a small dimensional Euclidean space is accomplished while optimizing for a small number of coefficients. We provide a theoretical support and demonstrate that working in the natural eigenspace of the data, one could reduce the process complexity while maintaining the model fidelity. As examples, we efficiently canonize nonrigid shapes by embedding their intrinsic metric into , a method often used for matching and classifying almost isometric articulated objects. Finally, we demonstrate the method by exposing the style in which handwritten digits appear in a large collection of images. We also visualize clustering of digits by treating images as feature points that we map to a plane.},

It is shown that, following the occurrence of a signal on either of the separate control charts, the values from both of the corresponding signaling statistics can be decomposed into interpretable elements. Viewing the two decompositions together helps one to specifically identify the individual components and associated variables that are being affected.

	abstract = {Multivariate process monitoring and diagnosis is an important and challenging issue. The widely adopted Hotelling T{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum} control chart can effectively detect a change in a system but is not capable of diagnosing the root causes of the change. The MTY approach makes efforts to improve the diagnosability by decomposing the T{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum} statistic. However, this approach is computationally intensive and has a limited capability in root-cause diagnosis for a large dimension of variables. This paper proposes a causation-based T{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum} decomposition method that integrates the causal relationships revealed by a Bayesian network with the traditional MTY approach. Theoretical analysis and simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method substantially reduces the computational complexity and enhances the diagnosability, compared with the MTY approach.

	abstract = {A major tool for quality control and management, statistical process control (SPC) monitors sequential processes, such as production lines and Internet traffic, to ensure that they work stably and satisfactorily. Along with covering traditional methods, Introduction to Statistical Process Control describes many recent SPC methods that improve upon the more established techniques. The author—a leading researcher on SPC—shows how these methods can handle new applications.

After exploring the role of SPC and other statistical methods in quality control and management, the book covers basic statistical concepts and methods useful in SPC. It then systematically describes traditional SPC charts, including the Shewhart, CUSUM, and EWMA charts, as well as recent control charts based on change-point detection and fundamental multivariate SPC charts under the normality assumption. The text also introduces novel univariate and multivariate control charts for cases when the normality assumption is invalid and discusses control charts for profile monitoring. All computations in the examples are solved using R, with R functions and datasets available for download on the author’s website.

Offering a systematic description of both traditional and newer SPC methods, this book is ideal as a primary textbook for a one-semester course in disciplines concerned with process quality control, such as statistics, industrial and systems engineering, and management sciences. It can also be used as a supplemental textbook for courses on quality improvement and system management. In addition, the book provides researchers with many useful, recent research results on SPC and gives quality control practitioners helpful guidelines on implementing up-to-date SPC techniques.},

Conventional statistical process control (SPC) methods, such as interpretation and decomposition of Hotelling’s T2-type statistic, are often computationally expensive in such high-dimensional problems. In this article, we frame fault isolation as a two-sample variable selection problem to provide a unified diagnosis framework based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We propose a practical LASSO-based diagnostic procedure which combines BIC with the popular adaptive LASSO variable selection method. Given the oracle property of LASSO and its algorithm, the diagnostic result can be obtained easily and quickly with a similar computational effort as least squares regression. More importantly, the proposed method does not require making any extra tests that are necessary in existing diagnosis methods. Finally, we present several specific SPC examples, including multistage process control and profile monitoring, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

	abstract = {Most research of run-to-run process control has been based on single-input and single-output processes with static input–output relationships. In practice, many complicated semiconductor manufacturing processes have multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) variables. In addition, the effects of previous process input recipes and output responses on the current outputs might be carried over for several process periods. Under these circumstances, using conventional controllers usually results in unsatisfactory performance. To overcome this, a complicated process could be viewed as dynamic MIMO systems with added general process disturbance and this article proposes a dynamic-process multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) controller to adjust those processes. The long-term stability conditions of the proposed controller are derived analytically. Furthermore, by minimizing the total mean square error (TMSE) of the process outputs, the optimal discount matrix of the proposed controller under vector IMA(1, 1) disturbance is derived. Finally, to highlight the contribution of the proposed controller, we also conduct a comprehensive simulation study to compare the control performance of the proposed controller with that of the single MEWMA and self-tuning controllers. On average, the results demonstrate that the proposed controller outperforms the other two controllers with a TMSE reduction about 32\% and 43\%, respectively.},

This paper presents a design approach for a residual-based exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) chart that mitigates this problem by modifying the control limits based on the level of model uncertainty. Using a Bayesian analysis, we derive the approximate expected variance of the EWMA statistic, where the expectation is with respect to the posterior distribution of the unknown model parameters. The result is a relatively clean expression for the expected variance as a function of the estimated parameters and their covariance matrix. We use control limits proportional to the square root of the expected variance. We compare our approach to two other approaches for designing robust residual-based EWMA charts and argue that our approach generally results in a more appropriate widening of the control limits.

The GLRT is applied to the uncorrelated residuals of the appropriate time-series model. The performance of the GLRT is compared to two other commonly applied residual-based tests - a Shewhart individuals chart and a CUSUM test. A wide range of ARIMA models are considered, with the conclusion that the best residual-based test to use depends on the particular ARIMA model used to describe the autocorrelation. For many models, the GLRT performance is far superior to either a CUSUM or Shewhart test, while for others the difference is negligible or the CUSUM test performs slightly better. Simple, intuitive guidelines are provided for determining which residual-based test to use. Additional advantages of the GLRT are that it directly provides estimates of the magnitude and time of occurrence of the mean shift, and can be used to distinguish different types of faults, e.g., a sustained mean shift versus a temporary spike.},

	abstract = {Automatic fault detection is becoming increasingly important in wastewater treatment plant operation, given the stringent treatment standards and the need to protect the investment costs from the potential damage of an unchecked fault propagating through the plant. This paper describes the development of a real-time Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) system based on an adaptive Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, used to compare the current plant operation with a correct performance model based on a reference data set and the output of three ion-specific sensors (Hach-Lange gmbh, Düsseldorf, Germany): two Nitratax® NOx UV sensors, in the denitrification tank and downstream of the oxidation tanks, where an Amtax® ammonium-N sensor was also installed. The algorithm was initially developed in the Matlab environment and then ported into the LabView 8.20 (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) platform for real-time operation using a compact Field Point®, a Programmable Automation Controller by National Instruments. The FDI was tested with a large set of operational data with 1 min sampling time from August 2007 through May 2008 from a full-scale plant. After describing the real-time version of the PCA algorithm, this was tested with nine months of operational data which were sequentially processes by the algorithm in order to simulate an on-line operation. The FDI performance was assessed by organizing the sequential data in two differing moving windows: a short-horizon window to test the response to single malfunctions and a longer time-horizon to simulate multiple unrepaired failures. In both cases the algorithm performance was very satisfactory, with a 100\% failure detection in the short window case, which decreased to 84\% in the long window setting. The short-window performance was very effective in isolating sensor failures and short duration disturbances such as spikes, whereas the long term horizon provided accurate detection of long-term drifts and proved robust enough to allow for some delay in failure recovery. The system robustness is based on the use of multiple statistics which proved instrumental in discriminating among the various causes of malfunctioning.},
